## Preface

When I joined Design Tech High School (tm), I had experimented a little bit with
programming but I had never programmed anything large.
Of course, the first thing I wanted to program was a game because
"it'll be fun".
I had seen [@digitalagedragon](https://github.com/digitalagedragon) playing
nethack a few years prior during school and figured that since it was leet and
text based, it would be easier to make something similar.
After I bothered Marcus for about three hours, he agreed to help me out.
We used this cursed software called "edity" that used Google's realtime api.
It worked but it also kinda sucked and de-synced.
One of the first things Marcus taught me was nested `for` loops for iterating
through matrices.
In this case, the goal was to iterate through every tile on the map.
Shortly afterwards, Joshua started helping out with the architecure of the
entire thing. I didn't actually do a whole lot of programming.
I did trivial things like creating the maps and puzzles.
I also added music and fonts.
Basically **everything** else was done by those two.
While watching them program,
I slowly started to understand small chunks of code.
This project was a great way to learn programming through immersion.
We finished this project in about three weeks.
It would be the first and the last project that
the three of us would ever work on together.
I had some pretty dope friends leading me along the way.
Thanks, both of you.

## About The Code

So if you actually want to read the code, well, good luck.
It's honestly a mess but I'm super proud that it works.
I've tried to keep it the same as when we finished, bugs and all.
You can even see some leftover salt left in the code if you squint.
I did update the rickroll url since that was a crucial part of the game >:).
If it looks like three different people with vastly different programming styles
created this, well...

## How To Play

#### Movement

| ? | key |
| - | --- |
| ↑ | w   |
| ← | a   |
| ↓ | s   |
| → | d   |
| ↖ | q   |
| ↗ | e   |
| ↙ | z   |
| ↘ | c   |

#### Other

| what | key |
| ---- | --- |
| burn a turn (sometimes?) | x |
| *toggle* inventory | i |
| use selected weapon | f |
| reset | r |
| activate cole mode (cheats) | 8 |

#### Tiles

I don't really remember what all of the tiles are.
If it moves, you probably don't want to touch it.

### Legal

There are some assets that I don't own in this project such as the soundtrack.
Please don't sue me, Nexon.
